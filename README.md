# TwitVidStitcher
**TwitVidStitcher** is a script that, given the URL to a playlist that Twitter uses for its video tweets, can get all the pieces to the video, download them, and stitch them together to a full-length video. URLs can have the original backslashes or not.

This is a very rudimentary script for a specific use case. This doesn't scrape the playlist URL from the site, so you have to use your browser and "inspect" the video element to find the URL. But it served its purpose well and was fun to make.
